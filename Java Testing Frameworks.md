### Java Unit Testing Frameworks & tools
A testing framework is a set of guidelines or rules used for creating and designing test cases. A framework is comprised of a combination of practices and tools that are designed to help QA professionals test more efficiently.
Base Unit Testing Frameworks
  * Junit
  * TestNG
  * JTest
  * JWalk
  * JBehave
  * Serenity
  * Qunit
  * Cucumber
Mocking Frameworks
    When writing unit tests, it is often required to mock or stub dependencies.Mocking is preferred to stubbing. 
  * Mockito
  * EasyMock
  * PowerMock
Writing Great Asserts Using AssertJ/Hamcrest
  * AssertJ
  * Hamcrest
Using Spring Unit
  Typical applications have multiple layers and you want to write unit tests for different layers — web, business, and data.

  Here are some of the recommended options:

  Web layer — Spring MockMVC
  Data layer — DataJpaTest
  Business layer — Mockito-based test preferably without launching a Spring Context
